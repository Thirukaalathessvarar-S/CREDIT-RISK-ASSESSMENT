# Real-Time Credit Risk Assessment Using Alternative Data
## Overview

This project aims to develop a real-time credit risk assessment system by analyzing alternative data sources such as utility payment records, UPI transaction history, and social media behavior. The goal is to assess creditworthiness for individuals who lack traditional credit histories but demonstrate financial discipline through non-traditional data.
Project Objectives

    Real-Time Assessment: Create a system that evaluates credit risk using alternative data in real-time.
    Data Aggregation: Integrate utility payments, UPI transactions, and social media data to provide a holistic view of an individual's financial behavior.
    Machine Learning Model: Train a model to predict credit risk and default likelihood using a combination of traditional and alternative data sources.
    Transparent Scoring: Provide lenders with explainable and transparent credit risk scores.

## Data Sources

    Utility Payment Records:
        Example: Timely payment of electricity, water, or mobile bills reflecting financial reliability.
        Why It Matters: Shows financial discipline and reliability.
    UPI Transaction History:
        Example: Daily transactions made via UPI, showcasing spending habits, savings, and cash flow.
        Why It Matters: Provides insight into financial activity in a largely cashless economy.
    Social Media Behavior:
        Example: Sentiment analysis of posts, activity patterns, and social signals (e.g., Twitter).
        Why It Matters: Provides additional context on financial behavior and stability beyond transactional data.

## How It Works

    Data Collection: Aggregate data from utility bill payments, UPI transaction history, and social media.
    Data Processing: Clean and preprocess data to ensure quality and relevance.
    Machine Learning: Use machine learning models to predict credit risk based on the combined data sources.
    Transparent Scoring: Generate explainable credit risk scores for lenders to make informed decisions.
